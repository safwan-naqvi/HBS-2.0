        question: "What are the differences between referral partner and agency partner?",
        answer:
            "Referral partners can be anyone from a content creator to a developer to an agency. Referral partners act on their own accord to refer users to DigitizeBird and maintain a very low touch point in converting the customer. Agency or developers maintain a close relationship with DigitizeBird and require a contract signing to get started. There are also more benefits to being an agency or developer partner. To find out these perks contact our partner team at redwan@digitizebird.ai.",
